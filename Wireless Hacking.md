### What is Wireless Network?
A wireless network connects devices using radio waves, allowing them to communicate without physical cables. It is cost-effective and easy to set up, with a wireless router serving as the primary device for internet connectivity.

### What is Wireless Hacking?
Wireless hacking involves exploiting vulnerabilities in wireless networks to gain unauthorized access. Attackers can monitor data traffic, often using techniques like Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks to capture sensitive information.

### Wireless Network Algorithms
Wireless networks use various algorithms for security, including SSID (network name), BSSID (MAC address of the access point), and different security protocols like WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 to protect data transmission.

### Wireless Information Gathering
This process involves collecting data about a wireless network, such as SSID, BSSID, channel, and encryption algorithm. Tools like airodump-ng are commonly used for this purpose.

### Wireless Network Vulnerabilities/Hacking Methods
Common vulnerabilities include WPS attacks, handshake brute force, WEP attacks, and evil-twin attacks. These methods exploit weaknesses in wireless security protocols to gain access to networks.

### Defense Techniques
To secure wireless networks, it is crucial to use strong encryption protocols (like WPA3), disable WPS, and regularly update router firmware. Users should also employ strong, unique passwords.

### Bluetooth Hacking
Bluetooth hacking involves exploiting vulnerabilities in Bluetooth connections, allowing attackers to send messages, take control of devices, or perform denial-of-service attacks. Tools are available for Bluetooth penetration testing.

### SS7 Attack
SS7 attacks exploit weaknesses in the SS7 signaling protocol, allowing attackers to intercept calls, SMS messages, and track users' locations. This method requires specialized equipment to intercept cellular signals.
